# magicEightBall

In this project we will build a Magic Eight Ball using control flow in JavaScript.

The user will be able to input a question, then our program will output a random fortune.

Here are 8 Magic Eight Ball phrases that weâ€™d like to save to the variable eightBall:

'It is certain'
'It is decidedly so'
'Reply hazy try again'
'Cannot predict now'
'Do not count on it'
'My sources say no'
'Outlook not so good'
'Signs point to yes'
